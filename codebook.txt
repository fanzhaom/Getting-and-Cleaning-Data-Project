This is the codebook for the newData dataset. 
It comes from updating existing codebooks in the UCI HAR Dataset.

The dataset has 180 observations and 69 variables in total.

subject: 
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
They are assigned with number 1-30.

activity:
Each person performed six activities: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING.

set:
Subjects were assigned to 2 groups: train and test for further study.

timeBodyAccMeaninXaxis to freqBodyGyroJerkMagSTD:
We extracted 66 mesurements from the original dataset. 
33 of them are mean value of mesurement, and the other half are standard deviation.
We grouped the data by subject and activity, then summarized them by calculating the average of each variable.

anything started with time: time domain signals
anything started with freq: frequency domain signals

Acc: accelerometer sensor signals
gyro: gyroscope sensor signals

Mag: magnitude

inXaxis: data captured in X axis
inYaxis: data captured in Y axis
inZaxis: data captured in Z axis

The unit for Acc is metres per second per second (m/s^2)
The unit for Gyro is radian per second (rad/s)
